### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This project analyzes bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project uses a Python script (`bikeshare_2.py`) to perform data analysis and generate useful statistics such as the most popular bike ride, the average duration of trips, and more. The data is stored in CSV files for each city and used as input to the script.

### Files used
- `bikeshare_2.py`: The Python script that performs data analysis.
- `chicago.csv`: The CSV file containing bikeshare data for Chicago.
- `new_york_city.csv`: The CSV file containing bikeshare data for New York City.
- `washington.csv`: The CSV file containing bikeshare data for Washington.

### Credits
- Inspired by the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.
- Used [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data analysis.
- Used [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical operations.
